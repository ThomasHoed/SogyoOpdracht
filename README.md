# Sogyo Opdracht

### 15-01-2021

This assignment was made as part of an assessment for Sogyo
It contains scripts/objects that will allow you to play a game of Tic-Tac-Toe

In order to play the game you need to run main.py
To run main.py requires 3 objects that are located in the subfolder Objects

IMPORTANT: Before you run main.py two libraries need to be installed
  - matplotlib
  - numpy

The random module is also used as import but is an inbuilt module in python and does not need an explicit download to my knowledge

When starting out with the design I was aiming to create the option to change the size of the playerboard. During the assignment I realized that this would take much more effort than I expected. Therefore, I abandonded this plan
However, you still will find many piece of code that will adapt dynamically when changing the boardsize.
